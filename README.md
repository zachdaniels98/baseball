# Baseball

This repo contains exploratory work I've done as a personal project. The goal of this project was to be both a learning experience in terms of coding and data analytics and also as a way for me to explore the depths of all the data baseball has to offer. I plan to update the contents of this repo periodically as I complete more work.


# pitchStatTests

Looking at pitching data and how missed calls are associated with different pitch types and counts. Work in progress, and planning on adding to it.
