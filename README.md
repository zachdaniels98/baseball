# Baseball

This repo contains exploratory work I've done as a personal project. The goal of this project was to be both a learning experience in terms of coding and data analytics and also as a way for me to explore the depths of all the data baseball has to offer. I plan to update the contents of this repo periodically as I complete more work.

### B455 Final Project

This is my final project from my Machine Learning class I took my final semester of college. It uses basic neural nets to classify pitch type for Clayton Kershaw's 2011 and 2019 seasons. This project is the basis for this whole repository and I knew that I wanted to expand on the work in this notebook and baseball data in general as a personal project.

### bbref_scraper

A webscraper that I wrote to enable me to get baseball data from baseball-reference.com. I started out with this to learn basic webscraping. Depending on my needs for future data and the capabilities of other public modules I may add more functions.

### awardMarkers

In this notebook I explored Cy Young winners' data and Clayton Kershaw's career Wins/Losses over the course of each of his seasons. I used bbref_scraper.py for all the necessary data. 

### pitchStatTests

Looking at pitching data and how missed calls are associated with different pitch types and counts. Work in progress, and planning on adding to it.
